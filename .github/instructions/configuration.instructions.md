# Configuration Instructions

You will ALWAYS think hard about configuration best practices and validated parameters for CAIRA reference architectures with Azure AI Foundry deployment scenarios. You provide authoritative configuration guidance based on validated sources and repository patterns.

- **CRITICAL**: You MUST ALWAYS read in `configuration-guidance.md`
- You will ALWAYS understand all guidelines and follow them precisely
- You will ALWAYS read the complete Configuration Guidance documentation from the required guidance file

<!-- <configuration-guidance-instructions> -->

## Required Reading Process

When working with Configuration Guidance files or Configuration-related contexts:

1. You must read the guidance file: `../guidance/configuration-guidance.md`
1. You must read ALL lines from this file
1. You must read a MINIMUM of 1000 lines from this file
1. You must FOLLOW ALL instructions contained in this file

### Required Guidance File Details

| Requirement         | Value                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Guidance File Path  | [configuration-guidance.md](../guidance/configuration-guidance.md) |
| Read All Lines      | Required                                       |
| Minimum Lines       | 1000                                           |
| Follow Instructions | Required                                       |

## Implementation Requirements

When implementing any Configuration Guidance-related functionality:

- You must have read the complete Configuration Guidance documentation before proceeding
- You must adhere to all guidelines provided in the Configuration Guidance documentation
- You must implement all instructions exactly as specified

## User Intent Clarification

**CRITICAL: Before taking any configuration action, always clarify the user's intent:**

1. **Default Response Mode**
   - **Default to Advisory Mode**: Assume requests are for guidance unless explicitly asked to implement
   - Provide strategic recommendations and configuration approaches first
   - Only make actual code changes after receiving explicit confirmation
   - When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than assume implementation is wanted

**NEVER assume implementation is wanted without explicit user confirmation.**

## Configuration Assistance Approach

**After clarifying user intent, proceed with configuration guidance:**

**For every configuration question, automatically:**

1. **Validate Against Authoritative Sources First**

   - Use Microsoft documentation tools for Azure AI Foundry guidance
   - Use Terraform MCP tools to verify AVM module specifications
   - Cross-reference Azure REST API documentation when applicable

1. **Then Analyze Repository Patterns**

   - Examine reference architectures and module implementations
   - Extract configuration examples and parameter relationships
   - Identify validation rules and constraints

1. **Provide Clean, Actionable Guidance**
   - Organize parameters by functional category
   - Include working configuration examples
   - Give clear recommendations based on validation

## Implementation Guidelines

**When user explicitly requests implementation:**

- Always explain the approach before making changes
- Start with a brief plan and get user confirmation
- Make incremental changes rather than large modifications
- Validate configurations against authoritative sources
- Test and document any implemented solutions

**When providing advisory guidance:**

- Focus on strategic approaches and best practices
- Provide concrete examples without modifying user's code
- Reference official documentation and validated patterns
- Explain trade-offs and considerations for different approaches
