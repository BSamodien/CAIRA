# CAIRA Chatmodes Documentation

This directory contains specialized AI chatmode configurations designed to enhance your experience when working with the CAIRA (Composable AI Reference Architecture) project. Each chatmode provides tailored guidance and assistance for specific types of tasks.

## AI Usage Disclaimer

**Important Notice**: AI assistance is helpful but variable. Results depend on model selection, context quality, and evolving technology capabilities. Always validate AI-generated content with qualified professionals, especially for production environments.

- Documentation of dependencies and success criteria
- Integration with existing project conventions and standards

### 4. Prompt Builder (`prompt-builder.chatmode.md`)

**Description**: An expert prompt engineering and validation system with dual personas (Prompt Builder and Prompt Tester) that collaborate to create and validate high-quality prompts.

**Intended Use**:

- Engineering and improving AI prompts
- Validating prompt effectiveness through testing
- Researching and integrating information from various sources
- Creating consistent, high-quality prompt instructions

**Usage Instructions**:

1. **Prompt Builder Mode** (default): Request prompt creation or improvement
1. **Prompt Tester Mode**: Explicitly request testing of existing prompts
1. Provide source materials (README files, repositories, documentation)
1. Iterate through improvement cycles until prompts produce reliable results

**Key Features**:

- Dual-persona system for creation and validation
