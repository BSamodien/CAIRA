## GitHub Actions

[actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) is used to lint all GitHub Actions workflows.

The command to execute is:

```sh
task gh:lint
```

## Markdown

[David Anson's markdownlint-cli2](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2) is leveraged for linting markdown.

The command to execute is:

```sh
task md:lint
```

> [!NOTE]
> Markdown linter runs automatically following `task docs` to lint autogenerated files.

## Terraform

Terraform linting includes [terraform fmt](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/fmt), [tflint, including autofix](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/blob/master/docs/user-guide/README.md) and [trivy for misconfiguration](https://trivy.dev/latest/docs/scanner/misconfiguration/).

The command to execute is:

```sh
task tf:lint
```

## Spelling

[Lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee) is used to check for broken links and [cspell](https://cspell.org/) for spelling in markdown files. This repository defaults to US English. If your documentation introduces a word that fails the spelling validation, add it to the [.cspell.yml file](https://github.com/microsoft/CAIRA/blob/main/.cspell.yml)

The command to execute is:

```sh
task: spell:lint
```

## YAML

[yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is used to lint YAML.

The command to execute is:

```sh
task: yml:lint
```

## Go

[golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) and [govulncheck](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck) are used to lint Go code.

The command to execute is:

```sh
task: go:lint
```

## Security

[gitleaks](https://gitleaks.io/) and [checkov](https://www.checkov.io/) are used for security checks.

The command to execute is:

```sh
task sec:lint
```
