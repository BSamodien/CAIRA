## How to File Issues and Get Help

This project is provided "as-is" without any official support from Microsoft. If you encounter any issues or have feature requests, you can file them through GitHub Issues. Please follow these steps:

1. **Search Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, please check the existing issues in the repository to see if your problem or request has already been reported. This helps avoid duplicates and can save time.

1. **File a New Issue:** If you do not find an existing issue that matches your problem, feel free to open a new one. Clearly describe the problem or feature request, providing as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable.

    * Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/CAIRA/issues) section of this repository.
    * Click on the "New Issue" button.
    * Select the appropriate issue template (if available) and fill out the required details.

Please note that while we welcome your issues and feedback, there is no guaranteed timeline for addressing these issues. The maintainers of this repository will review and prioritize issues as time permits.
