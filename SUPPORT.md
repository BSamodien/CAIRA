## How to streamline the response process

1. **Search Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, please verify that the existing issues in the repository do not already reflect the issue you are facing or the feature that you are requesting. This helps avoid duplicates and can save time.
1. **File a New Issue:** If you do not find an existing issue that matches what you are experiencing, feel free to open a new one by:
   1. Going to the [Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/CAIRA/issues) section of this repository.
   1. And click on [New Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/CAIRA/issues/new/choose).
1. **Use the correct issue template**  and clearly describe the issue or feature request, providing as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable. Be sure to call out actual vs expected behavior in your report.

## Escalation Path

1. GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/CAIRA/issues) for bugs and feature requests
1. Security vulnerabilities: [cmaint@microsoft.com](mailto:cmaint@microsoft.com) (private disclosure)
